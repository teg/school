This is a simple portal for an online school

It has three users:

Teachers:
  open/close timeslots
  comment on students
  comment on lessons
Students:
  sign up for/cancel lessons
  pay
Prospective students:
  see prices, sample material, videos etc etc

TODO
1) Enable signup/login
2) Present the correct features to the user based on his/her role (signed in as teacher,student or not signed in at all)
     preferably the three usecases should be reached by going to teachers.school.com, students.school.com, www.school.com, respectively
3) Integrate with payment solution (paypal)
4) Allow multiple teachers (low priority)
