This is a simple portal for an online school

It has three users:

Teachers:
  open/close timeslots
  comment on students
  comment on lessons
  set/change standard timeslots
Students:
  sign up for/cancel lessons
  pay
Prospective students:
  see prices, sample material, videos etc etc

TODO
1) Make a sensible UI
2) Test, test and test the payments some more!
3) Allow multiple teachers (low priority)
